Dr. Ge is now a lecturer at Hebei University of Technology. He obtained his B.Eng. degree in civil engineering from University of Science and Technology Beijing in 2015. Afterwards, he started my doctoral study under supervision of Dr. Nicholas Alexander and Dr. Mohammad Mehdi Kashani at the University of Bristol. In 2020, he finished his Ph.D. study entitled "Seismic performance of corroded reinforced concrete bridge piers: A large-scale shaking table study". His research interests mainly focus on the seismic design of bridges.
